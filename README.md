# LorenzOS Unity Demo

🚦 **LorenzOS** is an AI-powered air traffic coordination system for autonomous aerial vehicles — think of it as the operating system for the sky.

This Unity simulation demonstrates how next-gen eVTOLs and drone-cars can self-organize using directional rules, altitude conventions, and AI logic to avoid collisions — all without relying on outdated tower-based ATC.

## ✈️ Why LorenzOS?

We're entering an era where hundreds of drones and personal aerial vehicles will share the same urban airspace. Traditional air traffic control won't scale. LorenzOS simulates the logic and behavior of a decentralized, software-defined sky — the infrastructure layer for the next transportation revolution.

## 🧠 Core Features

- **Top-Down & Side-View Simulations**  
  Visual demos of how heading rules and virtual altitude layers prevent conflicts between aircraft

- **Directional Violations + Real-Time Warnings**  
  A "rogue" vehicle enters a heading or layer it shouldn’t, triggering a warning — ideal for visualizing risks

- **Unity-Powered Visuals**  
  Lightweight, modular scenes for testing AI behavior and rule enforcement

- **Hardware-Agnostic Design**  
  Meant to integrate with any eVTOL or drone control system via future APIs

## 👨‍🚀 About the Creator

Hi, I’m **Peter Roman**, founder of **Lorenz** — a skunkworks effort to build the future of flight.

- 🛸 Inventor of the **Lorenz Aeroboticar** (ducted-fan flying car — patent granted)
- 🔧 CAD designer + Unity dev + idea machine
- 🎥 Documenting the whole journey [on Instagram](https://instagram.com/lorenz.motors)

This project is fully bootstrapped and solo-developed — for now.

## 💸 What I’m Raising

I’m looking to raise **$500K–$1M** to:

- Build a full-scale LorenzOS prototype with real drone integration  
- Expand to a cloud-based API that allows manufacturers to plug into the system  
- Begin regulatory conversations with the FAA and airspace authorities

---

## 🧪 How to Use This Project

1. Clone the repo  
2. Open it in Unity 2022.3+  
3. Hit Play — and watch the AI enforce rules or deal with rogue vehicles (Game Keys: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Q, W, E, A, S, D)
